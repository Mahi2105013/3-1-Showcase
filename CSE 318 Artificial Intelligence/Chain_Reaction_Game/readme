Rules of the Game
1. The gameplay takes place on an m×n board. The most commonly used size of the board is 9x6 (9 rows, 6 columns).
2. For each cell in the board, we define a critical mass. The critical mass is equal to the number of orthogonally adjacent cells. That would be 4 for usual cells, 3 for cells in the edge and 2 for cells in the corner.
3. All cells are initially empty. The Red and the Blue player take turns to place "orbs" of their corresponding colors. The Red player can only place an (red) orb in an empty cell or a cell which already contains one or more red orbs. When two or more orbs are placed in the same cell, they stack up.
4. When a cell is loaded with a number of orbs equal to its critical mass, the stack immediately explodes. As a result of the explosion, to each of the orthogonally adjacent cells, an orb is added and the initial cell loses as many orbs as its critical mass. The explosions might result in overloading of an adjacent cell and the chain reaction of explosion continues until every cell is stable.
5. When a red cell explodes and there are blue cells around, the blue cells are converted to red and the other rules of explosions still follow. The same rule is applicable for other colors.
6. The winner is the one who eliminates all orbs of the other player.

Game play:
The game has three modes:
1) Human VS Human (Two human players compete)
2) Human VS AI
3) AI VS AI

The heuristics that were used:
1. Orb Count Difference
This is the most fundamental and often the primary heuristic in many
games. It's a direct measure of who is "winning" in terms of pieces on the
board. In Chain Reaction, accumulating more orbs (pieces) than your
opponent is generally a good thing, as it indicates control and potential for
future explosions.
2.Critical mass potential
This heuristic focuses on offensive potential. In Chain Reaction, the game is
won by eliminating the opponent's orbs through chain reactions. Cells that
are close to their "critical mass" (the number of orbs needed to explode)
are highly valuable because they can trigger these chain reactions,
potentially capturing many opponent cells.
3. Board control (number of cells controlled) = number of player cells minus number of opponent cells
4. Threat detection (potential to explode next turn)
This heuristic focuses on defensive considerations and anticipating
opponent moves. If an opponent has a cell that is one orb away from
exploding, it represents an immediate threat. Ignoring such threats can lead
to massive chain reactions from the opponent, potentially losing the game.
5. Corner control
Corners are strategically very important in Chain Reaction. They have the
lowest critical mass (usually 2 orbs), meaning they explode very easily.
Controlling corners allows a player to initiate chain reactions with minimal
investment. Losing corners means the opponent can easily trigger
explosions from those points.
